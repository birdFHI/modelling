We are an infectious disease modelling group at FHI, the Norwegian Institute of Public Health. We develop and apply statistical and mathematical methods and tools for a variety of infectious diseases. Since 2020 we have primarily focused on Covid-19 and continue to perform extensive modelling for the Institute's and Norwegian government's response to the pandemic. For a more detailed description of our Covid-related work, please check out our [Projects](/modelling/projects) page. 

Our work also extends to influenza and related respiratory infections, Hepatitis C, Varicella, multi-drug resistant pathogens, etc. (see [Publications](/modelling/publications)).

We are a research-focused group consisting mostly of researchers and PhD students. We welcome collaborations -- please get in touch by email through our [People](/modelling/people) page! If you are interested in doing a Master's project with us, please also do get in touch.
