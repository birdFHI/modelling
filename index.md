We are the infectious disease modelling group at FHI, the Norwegian Institute of Public Health. We perform research into a variety of infectious diseases, notably including covid-19, for which we performed and still perform extensive modelling of various kinds for the Norwegian government and to support the Institute's response and handling of the pandemic. Please check out our [Projects](/projects) page for a description of some of our covid-related work. 

We are a research-focused group consisting mostly of researchers and PhD students. We welcome collaborations -- please get in touch by email through our [People](/people) page! If you are interested in doing a Master's project with us, please also do get in touch.
