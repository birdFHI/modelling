title: "Modelling for Surveillance and Forecasting"
---

We provide important modelling for the weekly surveillance of respiratory diseases in Norway published in [weekly reports](https://www.fhi.no/publ/statusrapporter/luftveisinfeksjoner/). Key contributions include:
- Nowcasting of the number of hospital admissions - For the key respiratory diseases there can be significant lag in the reporting of hospital admissions.
- Estimating trends and forecasting hospital admissions - We estimate the exponential growth rates and provide short-term forecasts of hospital admissions.
- Combining multiple data sources to estimate trends of covid-19 - Using data from multiple surveillance system to estimate the overall trend of covid-19 infections in Norway. 

In addtion to providing day-to-day modelling for surveillance activities we are very intersted in open research questions about how to best use statistical methods and modelling techniques to improve infectious disease surveillance. 

#### International forcasting hubs

We contribute to the following international forecasting hubs: 
- [ECDC Covid-19 forcasting hub (team: fjordhest)](https://covid19forecasthub.eu/index.html)
- [CDC Flusight (team: fjordhest)](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/flusight/flu-forecasts.htm)
- [ECDC Respicast (team: fjordhest)](https://respicast.ecdc.europa.eu/#/home)

For all the forecasts we combine multiple time-series and mathematical models to using a weighted ensamble approach.
