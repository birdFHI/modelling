title: "Modelling for Surveillance and Forecasting"
---

We provide important modelling for the weekly surveillance of respiratory diseases in Norway published in [weekly reports](https://www.fhi.no/publ/statusrapporter/luftveisinfeksjoner/). Key contributions include:
- Nowcasts of the number of hospital admissions - For key respiratory diseases there can be significant lag in the reporting of hospital admissions, and nowcasts estimate the 'fully observed' hospitalisations.
- Estimates of trends and near-term forecasts of hospital admissions - We estimate the exponential growth rates and provide one- to four-week ahead forecasts of hospital admissions.
- Combining multiple data sources to estimate trends of Covid-19 - Using data from multiple surveillance systems to estimate the overall trend of Covid-19 infections in Norway. 

In addtion to providing day-to-day modelling for surveillance activities, we are very interested in open research questions about how best to use statistical methods and modelling techniques to improve infectious disease surveillance. 

#### International forcasting hubs

To support surveillance activities outside of Norway, we contribute weekly forecasts to the following international hubs: 
- [ECDC Covid-19 Forecast hub (team: fjordhest)](https://covid19forecasthub.eu/index.html)
- [ECDC RespiCast (team: fjordhest)](https://respicast.ecdc.europa.eu/#/home)
- [CDC FluSight (team: fjordhest)](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/flusight/flu-forecasts.htm)

For all forecasts, we combine multiple time-series and mechanistic models using a weighted ensemble approach.
