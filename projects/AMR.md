#### Methicillin-resistant *Staphylococcus aureus* (MRSA) transmission in Norway
 The project has developed a stochastic agent-based model to investigate the spread of MRSA in community and healthcare settings in Norway [here](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1900959116)

#### Impact of the patient referral network on the spread of AMR

The research activities investigate the characteristics of the network of patient movements between hospitals in the South-Eastern region of Norway.

The project also focuses on the development of network models to investigate the spread of MRSA outbreaks within the hospital network.
