We have recently worked together with NIPH epidemiologists to build a stochastic, compartmental model of the hepatitis C epidemic in Norway, focusing on prevalence and incidence of the disease, and the impact of treatment. Our paper on this is currently under review. The code for the model is available [here](https://github.com/folkehelseinstituttet/hepatitis_C_model/)
